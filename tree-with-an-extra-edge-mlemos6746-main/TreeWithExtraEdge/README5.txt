To implement the findCutEdge method, I used the concept of finding a bridge in a graph. In this case, we want to find an edge such that, when removed, a tree will still remain. 
This implementation uses the DisjointSets function to keep track of connected components and finds the cut edge by checking if the removal of an edge creates a cycle in the graph. The findCutEdge method returns the cut edge, or {-1, -1} if no cut edge is found.
